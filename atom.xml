    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apologies if it’s been a year since I did my last post. I got a bit lost due to a lot of commitments. But anyway moving forward, right now I am doing some pet projects and I plan to publish them here in Github so try to stay tuned.<br>Building open source software is also a great way to share ideas. </p>
<p>So I have this pet project that is a mobile app and also has a server side application. So that’s 2 projects I’m working on. I’m almost done with the server side, just a little adjustments to do. </p>
<p>If you have suggestions please feel free to share them :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi there so I have just created a new blog using hexo, a program that lets you publish static blogs. This is great since I can log all my updates in Github here.<br>From the projects I do to the other projects I find interesting. </p>
<p>So I have to admit, this isn’t very hard at first. I had to set up the project using hexo. Good thing there is  <a href="http://c9.io" target="_blank" rel="external">Cloud9</a>. An online ide and a virtual server as well. So I can install all the tools I need and edit the project wherever I go. I have also set up a <a href="https://github.com/jeremejazz/hexo-jeremejazz" title="Go to repository" target="_blank" rel="external">github repository</a> for this.<br>But anyway it is still rewarding since I have manage to generate a blog. </p>
<p>Hexo is a great tool especially for hosting that only allows static pages like HTML. It’s the javascript counterpart of Jekyll, which is using Ruby. The only thing Hexo is behind Jekyll is that github somehow where they are automatically generated when you push your Jekyll project, or that’s how I see it.<br>But anyway hexo is still a charmer since it has a one command deploy feature (hexo deploy).</p>
<p>So that’s it. I hope I can continue updating this blog especially on interesting projects here in Github. Well, I guess I have already started featuring one–Hexo. </p>
